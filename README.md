# Typescript Design Patterns
_A beginner-friendly, detailed guide to design patterns and SOLID principles in TypeScript, with real-world examples._

## Introduction

**ReactJS** makes use of design patterns like Composite, Observer, Factory, and Strategy. Similarly, **NestJS** uses more than eight patterns, including Dependency Injection, Decorator, and Singleton. The people behind the tools you use every day have a deep understanding of these patterns, helping them solve design challenges quickly and effectively.

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through **classic and modern design patterns**, as well as the **SOLID principles**. Weâ€™ll explain them in a clear, simple way and show you how theyâ€™re used in real-world projects. Itâ€™s designed to be **a go-to reference** you can return to whenever you need to refresh your ideas, and rocket your problem-solving and software design skills to the moon! ðŸš€

## What's a design pattern?
As its name suggests, a design pattern is like a **blueprint or programming template** that you can use and customize to solve commonly occurring problems in software design.

A design pattern isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all solution, but more of a helpful guide that shows you how others have tackled similar challenges before. Think of it as a reusable strategy for handling situations that come up often, especially in object-oriented programming (OOP).

In addition, it defines a common vocabulary that helps developers communicate more clearly and efficiently. By giving names to recurring design solutions, design patterns make it easier for teams to discuss complex concepts without needing lengthy explanations.

> ### ðŸš¨ Caution!
> - Design patterns aren't the same as algorithms. Algorithms are more like step-by-step instrucitons that help you get a specific task done.
> - Use them when it **truly** helps, not just because it sounds fancy.
> - Itâ€™s always better to focus on writing clean, understandable code first.
